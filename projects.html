                            The first step in creating a prototype based on OXO’s design principals is to know what they are. Smart Design, OXO’s equipment designer, states a simple ethos when designing products.

                        <h3>Designing</h3>
                        <p>
                            I started out by looking at images of existing OXO 
                            products in their Good Grips line. I found that nearly 
                            all products in this range had these characteristics.  
                        </p>
                        <ul class="base-ul">
                            <li class="nested">Solid large radius ovular handle </li>
                            <li class="nested">Solid color (black)</li>
                            <li class="nested">Simplictic, nothing special, no gimmicks</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            I took these physical characteristics and created basic
                            sketches which are shown on the right. I addressed the three characteristics in these ways

                        <h3>Prototyping</h3>
                        <p>
                            I followed the basic sketches to create a physical model of the screwdriver. 
                            From where tip of the screwdriver to the base where the battery is stored these are the features.            
                        </p>
                        <ul class="base-ul">
                            <li class="nested">Automatic interchangeable tip</li>
                            <li class="nested">Screen indicator for number of screws used </li>
                            <li class="nested">Speed selector for drill speed </li>
                            <li class="nested">Direction selector</li>
                            <li class="nested">Trigger for drilling</li>

                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Initially I had a large head for the tool but after testing I realized it was too bulky. 
                            I replaced it with a slimmer head to improve balance and simplicity. I also slimmed down 
                            the handle as I tested with users with smaller hands and they were unable to properly 
                            grip the screwdriver.

                    <h3>Testing</h3>
                    <p>I had my roommate perform a list of tasks to test the screwdriver. The list of tasks were, </p>
