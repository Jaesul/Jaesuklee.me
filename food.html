                <p>
                        Food for me is a hobby, a passtime, a stress reliever, a way to meet new people, 
                        a way to see old friends, an experience, a challenge, and a way to experience diversity.

                <h2>Korean Food</h2>
                <p>
                    My parents both grew up in rural Korea. They weren't shy about what they ate,
                    everything from pig's feet to chicken gizzards, they chefed it up and served it. 
                    My favorite Korean food is 삼겹살 (Samgyupsal), which is pictured above. It's had with
                    a few shots of soju and a group full of friends. It's basically uncured bacon.
                    It's name 삼겹살 is a description of the food itself. The first character 삼 means three, 겹 means layer, and 살 means fat, the literal translation being three layer fat.

                <div class="spacing-50px"></div>
                <h2>Pho</h2>
                <p>
                    My favorite noodle soup, Pho. Similar to another Korean soup, ox tail soup. The long simmered
                    broth has so much body. If I drank I'm sure I'd use it as a hangover cure. Nothing beats Pho 
                    on a cold rainy Seattle day.

                    way to eat chicken, American, cutlet, Korean, Thai, it's all good, and I love it all.
