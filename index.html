            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
              I’m a developer and UX designer, studying at the University of Washington.
            </p>
            <p>
              UX and software is my way of helping those in need. I’ve always been focused on
              two things, people and technology. UX brings together these two
              passions by focusing first on how to meet the needs of users
              through empathy, and second how to utilize technology to meet
              those needs. Software is the utilization of technology to 
              meet the needs of people.

                                  OXO, the well-known kitchen equipment company, innovated the 
                                  industry by designing tools with universality in mind. 
                                  This prototype takes OXO’s design philosophy and pairs it with a handheld screwdriver.

                                  The first step in creating a prototype based on OXO’s design principals is to know what they are. Smart Design, OXO’s equipment designer, states a simple ethos when designing products.  
                              </p>

                                      With Smart’s help, the OXO brand has continued to expand and evolve while remaining true to one simple but powerful idea: create products that make everyday life easier.

                              <p>
                                  I started out by looking at images of existing OXO 
                                  products in their Good Grips line. I found that nearly 
                                  all products in this range had these characteristics.  
                              </p>
                              <ul class="base-ul">
                                  <li class="nested">Solid large radius ovular handle </li>
                                  <li class="nested">Solid color (black)</li>

                              <p>
                                  I took these physical characteristics and created basic
                                  sketches which are shown on the right. I addressed the three characteristics in these ways

                              <p>
                                  I followed the basic sketches to create a physical model of the screwdriver. 
                                  From where tip of the screwdriver to the base where the battery is stored these are the features.            
                              </p>
                              <ul class="base-ul">
                                  <li class="nested">Automatic interchangeable tip</li>
                                  <li class="nested">Screen indicator for number of screws used </li>

                              <p>
                                  Initially I had a large head for the tool but after testing I realized it was too bulky. 
                                  I replaced it with a slimmer head to improve balance and simplicity. I also slimmed down 
                                  the handle as I tested with users with smaller hands and they were unable to properly 
                                  grip the screwdriver.

                              <p>
                                  Laser cutting, it’s amazing how fricking precise it is. This project was to create a laser cut object out of chipboard, a dense cardboard-like material 0.055mm thick. This object had a few design requirements.
                              </p>
                              <ul class="base-ul">
                                  <li class="nested">Must be cut from a single sheet of chip board 18 x 21 in</li>
                                  <li class="nested">Must not use any glue or tape to assemble</li>
                                  <li class="nested">Must be able to be disassembled into pieces and stored flat</li>
                                  <li class="nested">Must support the weight of a mobile device</li>
                              </ul>
                              <p>
                                  At first these requirements seemed unreasonable. I felt like it had a cheap feeling about it, like trying to drop an egg from a high place protecting it with just a few sheets of paper. But since I had the chance to learn new software and hardware, I just went along.

                              <h3>Ideation</h3>
                              <p>
                                  Then I realized how hard it would be. The model that was introduced to get our juices flowing was made of wood that joined at the corners, which would never work with the chipboard. I was pretty heated for a while until I saw a model that used chipboard to create a little phone stand. The stand along the width had slats that maintained the shape, while along the height had slats in the shape of rectangles to support it structurally. 
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                  With this idea I sketched out some ideas and began making a first draft, cutting out the chipboard with a knife. During the sketching process I thought of those “Waste Not” posters for lumber. The image shows how a single log of wood is turned into various types of lumber. I wanted to follow this ethos and tried to maximize the use of the chipboard through orientation of each piece and their shape. These first iterations came out better than I expected. With the rough cuts I made the model was able to hold up my laptop, not securely that is. I then moved over to 2d modeling to start the process of cutting on the chipboard.

                              <p>
                                  I decided to use Solidworks because it’s what I’m familiar with. And because I tried rhino and it was beyond difficult to use. It was almost like it’s a software made for just CAD engineers. The modeling process was fairly pain free; I’ll say that was due to the first draft I made without the laser printer. I exported the file from Solidworks to illustrator to color the lines to the appropriate color, red for cutting, blue for scoring, and black for rasterizing.

                                  I went to the laser cutter and cut out the pieces and slotted them together. After trying to fit them together I realized that the interference between the cuts makes the stand bow too much. Initially I thought that the interference between when slotting together the pieces would help the stand be more stable, but it turned out otherwise.

                              <p>
                                  To fix this issue I made each cut 0.55mm wide, the width of the chipboard, to make sure that there was no interference between parts. This solved the issue and allowed the pieces to fit together without any issues. I also rasterized a logo on the front.

                                  After demoing my stand with some testers, I revised the design. The users stated that the stop that held the tablet/ laptop in place was too flimsy and needed to be bolstered. To address this I added another horizontal support and widened the area.

                                  If I could do this project over, I would make sure that I’m consulting people who are familiar with the subject matter. I tried to watch videos to learn software like I always do but there were too many gaps in the instruction of the video. There were staff members that were there to help but I wanted to do it myself. Save the headache and just ask.

                                  It seems like this series of physical prototypes is me making useful tools for my girlfriend. I decided what to make by asking what useful thing she needed. She said that her beauty blender just sat on her makeup organizer to dry and that she wanted a stand to hold it. I told her that she would have to pay me if for this product. She didn’t pay me.

                                  The first thing I thought of was holes. IF the blender is to dry it needs proper circulation. The design I made first is sorta like a cylinder with a parabola revolve cut out of it. On the top it has a little ledge to stop the blender from touching the inner part from touching the sides of the holder. This idea was to promote air flow and to reduce bacteria growth. Really really really proud of my work I went on to model it in Solidworks.

                                  If you read my last blog on laser cutting, you’ll know that I’m kinda really good at Solidworks. I started with a few reference planes and lofted my cylinder. I shelled the loft and took away the top surface. After the loft I cut out the holes using an extrude cut. After cutting I made a liner pattern to go up the cylinder vertically, then a revolved pattern to go around the circumference. Then I did a simple revolve around the open end to create the lip that the blender would sit on. I think its important to note that I had no idea what the beauty blender dimensions were but going on what it felt like in my hands and pictures online. But it was okay doing this because Solidworks and the 3D cutting software allows you to scale before you execute the print.

                              <p>
                                  Printing was simple. You export your CAD file as a STL (I don’t know what that means) and upload it to a slicing software. From what I understand it slices your model into layers, that’s how the 3D printer works. It’s an additive method of printing, meaning layers are added. Unlike my girlfriend that is subtractive, just taking all my money and time. You input the settings; you really don’t need to mess with anything it’ll kinda just print. But really just set infill to 30% and hope your model doesn’t need supports because I don’t know how to do that. Export that as a 3XG file onto a removable storage drive (USB drive or SD card) and plug it into a printer. I used the Flash Forge at first, but the employees told me that they’re kind of garbage and to use the “Prusa”. That word rolls of the tongue and it makes it seem like you know what you’re talking about, so I used it a lot when I helped others 3D print and talked to the Makespace employees.

                                  This wouldn’t be a project unless there were problems. So, first the print failed. It just stopped, which sucks because it takes 5 hours to print and it failed 3 hours in. The print failed for unknown reasons. Second my girlfriend didn’t like the model I made… ungrateful huh? Here’s a quote from her.

                                  Back to square one, I guess. So, I decided to make a beauty blender holder that looks like a beauty blender holder. Where’s that meme of the guy in pimp my ride? <a href="https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/000/177/800px-Sup_dawg.jpg" target="blank">Here</a> it is.

                              <p>
                                  Since I’m so good with Solidworks I went back to the computer and whipped something up quick. It only took about 3 hours which was good time considering I didn’t really care since I met the requirements at this point (kidding). I printed it and it was way too big, I probably should have measured a real beauty blender.

                              <p>
                                  I scaled it down and make the platform larger proportionally, because it’s all about the proportions baby. This one came out really nice, because I actually got a real beauty blender to do the mockup.

                                  The final product was…. OKAY. I wanted to put ventilation holes on the bottom, but she didn’t want them, so we compromised, and I didn’t put the vents in. Additionally, I should have made the opening larger to allow her to grab it a little easier. All in all, it came out, well, okay. Here’s a video of her using it.

                                  If I could do this project over, I’d try and get the beauty blender in my hands to measure before I start designing. I thought I could just eyeball it and scale the model if it was off, but that didn’t work the way I thought it would. But overall, I think it went well. My girlfriend is happy which in turn makes me happy.

                                  They say, “Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and you feed him a lifetime”. With sewing it should be “Give a man a shirt and he’ll be clothed for a while, teach him how to sew and he’ll still need to ask for shirts because sewing is hard”. This project required me to create something out of fabric. I ended up with something, kinda of adjustable?

                                  Like I said previously, this series is basically me making stuff my girlfriend needs. The one thing she loves is comfortable clothes, so I thought why not make her some comfortable clothes? I’m not sure why but I thought she would appreciate some sweatpants, so I got to making some sweatpants.

                                  I’m gonna be honest, I have no idea how you design clothes so I just sent it. I asked my friend Lena to be my model to get measurements. They’re about the same size. Probably not actually but close enough. It doesn’t matter, none of the clothes ended up being able fit an actual human being. I did a few measurements, one at the waist, hip, and thigh. I took these measurements and transferred them to some fabric.

                                  Well I wasn’t going to just start how sewing these pants together with no experience. So, I took some random fabric and I started to learn. I realized that I shouldn’t ever consider doing anything delicate with my hands because I couldn’t really make straight lines. The bags came out pretty good, so I moved over to sewing the pants

                                  I forgot to take pictures while I was sewing the pants. But if I were to have had pictures, most of them would have been me rethreading the machine. So, here’s the final product!

                                  Don’t try to make pants. I measured about 10 times and it still came out wrong. The tube top I made was a pair of pants, but I messed it up and turned it into a tube top. I should probably have taken an old pair of pants and see how it was constructed. It’s weird because they look like they could fit someone, but they don’t even get over the legs of my girlfriend. Next time I’ll work with something simpler and then work my way up to something more advanced.

This assignment was originally made for 4 members but one of them dropped the class and the other was going on a trip somewhere, go figure, so it was just Ashley and me. We thought since we didn’t have the number of hands we should have, we choose what we thought was most feasible, the chatbot, nice.

                            <p>
                              We threw around some ideas with different ideas, most of which were terrible, but we were having a hard time ideating so we put a few out there, embarrassingly. These were the ideas. 
                            </p>
                            <ul class="base-ul">

                              The main idea that compelled the decision was cost. We honestly haven’t used travel agents, but we have gone on flights. We were more along the lines dreaming about if we get jobs in our respective industries how we would plan trips. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              But to get back to it, I think real person travel agents are expensive, or at least cost some amount of money, our virtual agent would hopefully be at least 80% of a real travel agent, but at 0% of the cost. Or maybe whatever the cost you think is the price of using free services that mine your data ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.

                              <strong>So, the final decision was to design a chatbot that finds transportation, lodging, and activities.</strong>

                            <p>
                                With the three features in mind, finding lodging, transportation, and activities we started writing a script. We realized that there was too much juggling if we let the user decide what days, where, and what activities. We thought about using a few of Google’s flights API’s and writing some code, but the scope of this project was too narrow to implement and test.             
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              We decided to be strict on the days, but have three options for location, which had three different choices of activities for each location.

                              We decided to use Facebook as our platform because of the ease of setup and because overlord Mark would be very pleased to see we’re creating fake chatbots. We setup a page that we apply named            
                            </p>
                            <h4>“The Good Looking Travel Bot”</h4>
                            <p>
                              We added some pictures to add some spice and make it seem more real to our tester. The bot works by the user messaging the bot and asking using some prompts.

                            I’d say the whole thing went pretty well. Chris admitted that he was bamboozled so in that case it was a success. We asked him a few follow up questions on the chat bot and how effective it would be, because apparently that was what the assignment was supposed to be? (Kidding).

                                How likely would you be to use the travel chatbot in the future?

                                What, if anything, was easy about working with the chatbot?

                                      The things I had to ask it were really specific, It would be great if I didn’t have to follow this script 
                                    </li>
                                </ul>

                          <p>
                            I asked my roommate Chris to do the test. I prefaced the test by telling him the bot was an experimental project that I was coding up that. And because it was something I was working on, the bot had to have some specified inputs. Man, I’m good          
                          </p>
                      </div>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content">
                      <h3>Video</h3>
                    </div>
                    <div class="side-by-side">
                        <div class="content">

                            <p>
                              The first is that I told Chris what to tell the chatbot and he forgot and just went with what he wanted. Ashley was on her toes and worked around it, but this was something we didn’t think of that we should have. Additionally, it would have been great to implement that code that I was talking about earlier to have allowed the user to choose whatever place, transportation, and activities that was desired. Other than that, I think it went pretty well! To those who read to the end, tyvm.
